This page is a bit of a repository for links to odds and ends, including R-packages, Shiny apps, code-snippets, and other on-going projects.


##Shiny apps

* [Corpus Search](https://jasontimm.shinyapps.io/corpusQuery/) -- An application built on the search functionality of `corpuslingr` for interactive corpus search. At present, the demo app makes available for search the Slate Magazine corpus from `corpusdatr`.  Swapping out the corpus with a personal one would be straightforward.
* [Word Association Networks](https://jasontimm.shinyapps.io/shiny_word-association-nets/) -- A simple application for investigating word association data made available via the South Florida Word Assocation Norms.
* [School Locator](https://jasontimm.shinyapps.io/school_locator/) for Albuquerque Public Schools -- Retrieve school locations, driving times, and school characteristics based on user-specified address in Bernalillo County.
