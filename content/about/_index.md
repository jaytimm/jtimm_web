My name is Jason Timm. I am parts linguist + data scientist + computational social scientist, with a [PhD in Linguistics](http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/ling_etds/45/) from the University of New Mexico. Presently, and very broadly, my research interests include: 

* linguistic innovation and change in online speech communities;
* political communication on social media;
* the integration of corpus methods and geographic information systems; and
* the development of open source tools for linguistic analysis & text featurization.
