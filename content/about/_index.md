My name is Jason Timm. I am a linguist and a data scientist, with a PhD in Linguistics from the University of New Mexico. My research interests include the cognitive & social mechanisms underlying processes of linguistic change within a speech community. [[Dissertation](http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/ling_etds/45/)]

More broadly, I am interested in: 

* the integration of corpus methods and geographic information systems; 
* the development of open source tools for text analysis;
* the application of corpus & computational methods in political science; and
* the interface between political ideology and social media use among American lawmakers.
