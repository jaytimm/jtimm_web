My name is Jason Timm. I am part academic researcher and part data scientist.  I received my PhD in Linguistics from the University of New Mexico in December 2016, where I trained as a corpus linguist and a psycholinguist. 

My research interests include computational & corpus-based approaches to (1) the mental lexicon, (2) lexical innovation, and (3) the cognitive and social mechanisms underlying processes of language change. [[Dissertation](http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/ling_etds/45/)]

More broadly, I am interested in: 

* the application of statistical computing to large text corpora; 
* the integration of corpus methods and geographic information systems; 
* the development of open source tools for text analysis; and 
* the application of corpus & computational methods in the social sciences and humanities.
