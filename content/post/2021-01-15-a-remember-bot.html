<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>A previous post <a href="https://www.jtimm.net/2020/11/06/time-lining-trump-presidency/">here</a> detailed a simple function (from the <code>uspols</code> package) for <a href="https://github.com/jaytimm/A-timeline-of-the-Trump-presidency">extracting the timeline of the Trump presidency</a> from Wikipedia. In this post, then, we turn this timeline into a Twitter bot – one that <a href="https://twitter.com/MemoryHistoric">remembers daily</a> what happened four years ago in the Trump presidency.</p>
<p>A fairly trivial task; what is a bit tricky, however, is (1) dealing with Twitter’s 280 character limit, and (2) automating the posting of <strong>Twitter threads</strong>, as Wikipedia’s daily accounting of the last four years can be fairly detailed. Via the <code>rtweet</code> package. For good measure, we demonstrate an unsupervised approach to adding hashtags to our tweet-threads in the form of named entities via <code>spacy</code> / <code>spacyr</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="timeline-content" class="section level2">
<h2>Timeline content</h2>
<p>The Trump timeline can be extracted using the <code>uspols::uspols_wiki_timeline()</code> function. A static table will shortly suffice.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># devtools::install_github(&quot;jaytimm/uspols&quot;)
library(tidyverse)
locals1 &lt;- uspols::uspols_wiki_timeline()

locals1 &lt;- subset(locals1, nchar1 &gt; 0)</code></pre>
<p>Details of table content returned from <code>uspols_wiki_timeline()</code>: we consider the 699th day of the Trump presidency. A Thursday.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>eg &lt;- locals1 %&gt;%filter(daypres == 699)
eg %&gt;% select(quarter:dow) %&gt;% slice(1) %&gt;% knitr::kable()</code></pre>

<p>As detailed below, Wikipedia summarizes the day’s happenings as individual “Events.” Some days were more eventful than others during the past four years. I have added a <code>bullet</code> column for simple enumeration; day 699, then, included four events. Per above, we have added some Event-level features relevant to a tweet-bot: sentence count and character count.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>eg %&gt;% select(bullet, nsent, nchar1, Events) %&gt;%
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, 
                options = list(dom = &#39;t&#39;,
                               pageLength = nrow(eg),
                               scrollX = TRUE))</code></pre>

<p>In this example, then, Events #3 and #4 will present problems from a character-limit perspective.</p>

<h2>Automated tweet-sizing of a thought</h2>
<div id="sentence-based" class="section level3">
<h3>Sentence-based</h3>
<p>One approach to “tweet-sizing” Wikipedia-based events is simply to extract sentences up until we exceed some character threshold. An easy solution. Below we eliminate stops as markers of abbreviation (eg, honorifics <code>Ms.</code> or <code>Dr.</code>) – which makes sentence tokenizers infinitely more useful.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>locals1$Events &lt;- gsub(&#39;([A-Z])(\\.)&#39;, &#39;\\1&#39;, locals1$Events) </code></pre>
<p>The function below extracts sentences from a larger text until the cumulative character count exceeds some number, as specified by the <code>chars</code> parameter. As we want to add some affixal matter to our tweet threads, we set this at 250.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>extract_sent1 &lt;- function(x, chars = 250) { 
  z1 &lt;- data.frame(ts = tokenizers::tokenize_sentences(x)[[1]])
  z1$nchar_sent &lt;- nchar(z1$ts) + 1
  z1$cum_char &lt;- cumsum(z1$nchar_sent)
  z2 &lt;- subset(z1, cum_char &lt; chars)
  paste0(z2$ts, collapse = &#39; &#39;)
  }</code></pre>
<p>The table below details the Events of Day 699 in tweet-ready length per our sentence extraction procedure. Per this method, we lose some (perhaps useful) detail from our thread.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Events &lt;- unlist(lapply(eg$Events, extract_sent1, chars = 250))

data.frame(nsent = tokenizers::count_sentences(Events),
           nchar1 = nchar(Events),
           Events = Events) %&gt;%
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, 
                options = list(dom = &#39;t&#39;,
                               pageLength = nrow(eg),
                               scrollX = TRUE))</code></pre>

<div id="via-ellipses" class="section level3">
<h3>Via ellipses</h3>
<p>If, instead, we wanted to preserve full event content, one approach would be to split text into ~280 character chunks (ideally respecting word boundaries), and piece thread together via ellipses. The function below is taken directly from this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49076769/dplyr-r-cumulative-sum-with-reset">SO post</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cumsum_reset &lt;- function(x, thresh = 4) {
    ans &lt;- numeric()
    i &lt;- 0

    while(length(x) &gt; 0) {
        cs_over &lt;- cumsum(x)
        ntimes &lt;- sum( cs_over &lt;= thresh )
        x      &lt;- x[-(1:ntimes)]
        ans &lt;- c(ans, rep(i, ntimes))
        i   &lt;- i + 1
    } 
    return(ans) 
    }</code></pre>
<p>The second function implements <code>cumsum_reset</code> in the context of counting characters at the word level – once a certain character-count threshold is reached, counting resets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>to_thread &lt;- function(x, chars = 250){ # no thread counts at present -- 
  
  x1 &lt;- data.frame(text = unlist(strsplit(x, &#39; &#39;)))
  x1$chars &lt;- nchar(x1$text) + 1
  x1$cs1 &lt;- cumsum(x1$chars)
  x1$sub_text &lt;- cumsum_reset(x1$chars, thresh = chars)
  
  x2 &lt;- aggregate(x1$text, list(x1$sub_text), paste, collapse = &quot; &quot;)

  x2$ww &lt;- &#39;m&#39;
  x2$ww[1] &lt;- &#39;f&#39;
  x2$ww[nrow(x2)] &lt;- &#39;l&#39;
  
  x2$x &lt;- ifelse(x2$ww %in% c(&#39;f&#39;, &#39;m&#39;), paste0(x2$x, &#39; ...&#39;), x2$x)
  x2$x &lt;- ifelse(x2$ww %in% c(&#39;l&#39;, &#39;m&#39;), paste0(&#39;... &#39;, x2$x), x2$x)
  paste0(x2$x, collapse = &#39; || &#39;) 
}</code></pre>
<p>For a demonstration of how these functions work, we use a super long event from the Wikipedia timeline – from 12 August 2018 (day 573) – which is over 1200 characters in length.</p>

<h2>Posting thread using <code>rtweet</code></h2>
<p>We can piece together these different workflows as a <a href="">simple script</a> to be run daily via <a href="https://github.com/bnosac/cronR">cron</a>. The daily script (not detailed here) filters the Event timeline to the day’s date four years ago, and then applies our <strong>tweet re-sizing functions</strong> to address any potential character-count issues.
