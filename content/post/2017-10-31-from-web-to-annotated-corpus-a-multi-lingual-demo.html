<p>This post demonstrates some methods for building multi-lingual corpora from web-based news content using my R package <code>quicknews</code>, as well as methods for annotating multi-lingual corpora using the <code>cleanNLP</code> <span class="citation">(Arnold <a href="#ref-arnold2017tidy">2017</a>)</span> and<code>udpipe</code> <span class="citation">(Wijffels <a href="#ref-Wijffels2018udpipe">2018</a>)</span> packages. In the process, this post lays a bit of a foundation for analyzing text data, and serves as a reference for some basic corpus concepts and common text structures.</p>

<h2>Simple web scraping</h2>
<p>The <code>quicknews</code> package streamlines two basic tasks relevant to building multi-lingual web corpora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieving metadata (including urls) for current articles posted on GoogleNews (via RSS) based on user-specified search parameters, and</li>
<li>Scraping article content from urls obtained from the RSS, and outputting content as a corpus data frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both functions depend on a combination of functionality made available in the <code>boilerpipeR</code>, <code>xml2</code>, and <code>RCurl</code> packages.</p>
<p>
<h4>
RETRIEVE METADATA
</h4>
</p>
<p>Here, we obtain metadata for the most current US-based, nation-related articles written in English.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>us_nation_meta &lt;- quicknews::qnews_get_meta (
  language=&quot;en&quot;, 
  country=&quot;us&quot;, 
  type=&quot;topic&quot;, 
  search=&#39;nation&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Additional <code>language</code> &amp; <code>country</code> searches (that I know work) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spanish/US (es/us),</li>
<li>Spanish/Mexico (es/mx),</li>
<li>French/France (fr/fr),</li>
<li>German/Germany (de/de).</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifics of <code>type</code> &amp; <code>search</code> parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>when <code>type</code> = “topic” (as above), <code>search</code> parameter options include business, world, health, science, sports, technology, and some others.</li>
<li>when the <code>type</code> parameter is set to “term”, the <code>search</code> parameter can be set to anything.</li>
<li>when the <code>type</code> parameter is set to “topstories”, the <code>search</code> parameter is ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>The call to <code>qnews_get_meta()</code> returns metadata for the 20 most recent articles by search type. Metadata include:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>colnames(us_nation_meta)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;lang&quot;    &quot;country&quot; &quot;search&quot;  &quot;date&quot;    &quot;source&quot;  &quot;title&quot;   &quot;link&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Article publication dates, sources, and titles returned from the call to Google News’ RSS feed are summarized below:</p>

<h4>
SCRAPE CONTENT
</h4>
</p>
<p>The <code>clr_web_scrape</code> function returns a <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/tif#text-interchange-formats">TIF</a>-compliant corpus dataframe, with each scraped text represented as a single row. Metadata from output of <code>clr_web_gnews</code> are also included.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>us_nation_corpus &lt;- us_nation_meta %&gt;% 
  quicknews::qnews_scrape_web () </code></pre>
<p>Example text from the corpus data frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>substr(us_nation_corpus$text[1],1,500)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;By Katie Reilly 1:18 PM EDT The valedictorian of Holy Cross High School in Covington, Kentucky, planned on delivering a graduation speech about the power of young voices on Friday, but he was barred from doing so after church leaders said his speech was \&quot;inconsistent with the teaching of the Catholic Church.\&quot; So he went outside after the ceremony and delivered it by megaphone instead. \&quot;I didn&#39;t think it was very polarizing. It was, like, about empowerment through youth,\&quot; Bales told local TV stat&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="corpus-annotation" class="section level2">
<h2>Corpus annotation</h2>
<p>Having built a simple corpus of the day’s news, the next step is annotation. Corpus annotation has become a fairly straightforward process with the open-source development of several natural language processing toolkits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stanford’s <a href="https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/">CoreNLP</a> java-based software</li>
<li>Python’s <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a> library</li>
<li>R’s <a href="https://bnosac.github.io/udpipe/en/">udpipe</a> package</li>
</ul>
<p>As CoreNLP and spaCy are Java- and Python-based applications, respectively, dependency wrappers are required for their use in R. <code>udpipe</code>, on the other hand, is a dependency-free R package.</p>
<p>
<h4>
cleanNLP &amp; udpipe
</h4>
</p>
<p>The <code>cleanNLP</code> package provides wrappers (and a singular interface) for all three of these annotators. Per this flexibility, we demo its usage here in annotating our web-based corpus, with a specific focus on the dependency-free annotator <code>udpipe</code>. (Note that <code>udpipe</code> can be installed &amp; used independently of <code>cleanNLP</code>.)</p>
<p>We initialize the annotator <code>udpipe</code> via a call to <code>cnlp_init_udpipe</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cleanNLP::cnlp_init_udpipe(
  model_name=&quot;english&quot;, 
  feature_flag = FALSE, 
  parser = &quot;none&quot;) </code></pre>
<p>Then we annotate the text using the <code>cnlp_annotate</code> function. Resulting output is a list of data frames, in which different features/types of annotations (eg, named entities, coreferences, dependencies, etc.) are stored seperately. We can access the standard annotation as the <code>token</code> element of the list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>us_nation_annotated &lt;- cleanNLP::cnlp_annotate (us_nation_corpus$text, 
                                                as_strings = TRUE) %&gt;%
  .$token %&gt;%
  filter(lemma !=&#39;ROOT&#39;) %&gt;%
  mutate(id = gsub(&#39;doc&#39;,&#39;&#39;, id))</code></pre>
<p>
<h4>
ANNOTATED CORPUS
</h4>
</p>
<p>The overall composition of the corpus is presented below; as can be noted, not all of the 20 articles included in the RSS have been successfully scraped. Not all websites allow non-Google entities to scrape their pages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>corpuslingr::clr_desc_corpus(
  us_nation_annotated,doc=&#39;id&#39;,
  sent=&#39;sid&#39;, 
  tok=&#39;word&#39;,

<pre><code>##    n_docs textLength textType textSent
## 1:     16      13305     3496      686</code></pre>
<p>Characteristics of constituent news articles:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>corpuslingr::clr_desc_corpus(us_nation_annotated,
                             doc=&#39;id&#39;,
                             sent=&#39;sid&#39;, 
                             tok=&#39;word&#39;, 
                             upos=&#39;upos&#39;)$text %&gt;%
  inner_join(us_nation_corpus, by = c(&#39;id&#39;=&#39;doc_id&#39;))%&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=textLength, 
             y=textType,
             color=source, 
             size=textSent))+

<p>The table below illustrates the first 1,000 tokens of our annotated corpus. Along with sentence identification and lemmatization, the annotation includes both universal part-of-speech tags (<code>upos</code>) and English-specific part-of-speech tags (<code>pos</code>).</p>
<p>Per text interchage formats, this particular data structure is referred to as a “tokens data frame object.”</p>

<h2>English part-of-speech tags</h2>
<p>For reference purposes, the table below presents English-specific part of speech tags (<code>pos</code>), including descriptions and some examples of each tag type. This tag set is (more or less) uniformly used across annotators, and is based on conventions established by the <a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">Penn Treebank Project</a>.</p>

<h2>Spanish web corpus</h2>
<p>Next, we take a quick look at building an annotated corpus of web-scraped news articles written in Spanish.</p>
<p>For a more analytic language like English (ie, a language with limited inflectional morphology), units of meaning can roughly be demarcated by spaces in a character string; the inflectional morphemes that do exist can be collapsed to language specific part-of-speech tags (eg, verb forms inflected for third-person singular in the present tense are coded as “VBZ”). And, as the table above attests, without proliferating all that many POS categories.</p>
<p>For a language richer in inflectional morphology like Spanish, on the other hand, demarcating units of meaning via spaces in a character string does not really work, as a single verb form, eg, is inflected for tense, aspect, mood, person, and number. Mapping multiple features of inflectional meaning for a given token to a single “POS” code, then, becomes a bit more challenging, and annotations reflect this. We consider some of these differences as we go.</p>
<p>
<h4>
RETRIEVE METADATA &amp; CONTENT
</h4>
</p>
<p>So, we first retrieve metadata for the most current Mexico-based, “world news” articles, and scrape text content from urls in a single pipe.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>es_mx_world_corp &lt;- quicknews::qnews_get_meta(language=&quot;es&quot;,
                                              country=&quot;mx&quot;,
                                              type=&quot;topic&quot;, 
                                              search=&quot;world&quot;)%&gt;% 
  quicknews::qnews_scrape_web ()</code></pre>

<h4>
ANNOTATE CORPUS
</h4>
</p>
<p>Again, we use <code>udpipe</code> via <code>cleanNLP</code> to annotate the Spanish language corpus, and initialize the annotator &amp; Spanish model with a call to <code>cnlp_init_udpipe</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cnlp_init_udpipe(model_name = &quot;spanish&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Annotate corpus data frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full_udpipe_es_ann &lt;- es_mx_world_corp%&gt;%
  select(doc_id,text)%&gt;%
  cleanNLP::cnlp_annotate(as_strings = TRUE) %&gt;%
  .$token%&gt;%
  filter(lemma !=&#39;ROOT&#39;)%&gt;%
  arrange(as.numeric(id))</code></pre>
<p>The basic “token-lemma-pos” annotation for Spanish via <code>udpipe</code> is presented below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>full_udpipe_es_ann %&gt;%

<h4>
ALTERNATIVE OUTPUT
</h4>
</p>
<p>It should be noted that different annototars, eg. <code>spacy</code> and <code>coreNLP</code>, structure feature output differently; namely, features of inflectional meaning are collapsed into a single column, generally as a language-specific pos column. Depending on the goal/endgame, one annotation structure may be more preferable than the other.</p>

<h2>Quick summary</h2>
<p>We do not rollcall all differences among languages/annotators here; instead, the goal has been to present a simple &amp; uniform workflow for bulding and annotating multi-lingual, web-based corpora.</p>
<p>Among other things, the <code>quicknews</code> and <code>cleanNLP</code>/<code>udpipe</code> packages facilitate the development of real-time, annotated corpora for tracking any number of cultural &amp; linguistic changes in-progress. Subsequent discussions on this site will consider different analyses that the corpus annotation enables, including fine-grained, complex search in context, network and topic analysis, and a host of distributional semantics models.</p>
