<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A simple function from the <a href="https://github.com/jaytimm/uspols">uspols</a> package – dubbed <code>uspols_wiki_timeline()</code> – that scrapes Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Donald_Trump_presidency">Timeline of the Donald Trump presidency</a>. Facilitating, among other things, the ability to hover over data points in a time series to see what the President was up to <strong>on any given day</strong> over the course of the last four years.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(devtools)
devtools::install_github(&quot;jaytimm/uspols&quot;)
library(uspols) </code></pre>
<p>A simple call to the function returns a table of the president’s daily happenings via Wikipedia – from 20 January 2017 to the most recent update. This is clearly not an official accounting, and Wikipedia is not gospel. <strong>But a super quick/easy way to get one’s bearings (in a maelstrom) and contextualize data points</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>longs &lt;- uspols::uspols_wiki_timeline()</code></pre>
<p><strong>Table structure is detailed some below</strong>. The folks at Wikipedia have delineated events (chronologically?) via bullet points per each day of Trump’s presidency, which have been enumerated here in the <code>bullets</code> column as independent rows. I have mostly done this to make text easier to read/access/etc. I am not sure how meaningful event distinctions (for a given day) actually are.</p>

<h3>A simple use-case</h3>

<p>For demonstration, we calculate total word counts of event descriptions per day from the time-line table. The plot below, then, summarizes these daily counts since inauguration. The plot itself is fairly meaningless, but the hover-action should be useful. For clarity purposes, only the first event for each day is included in the pop-up,.</p>
