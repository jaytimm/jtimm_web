<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jaytimm/uspols">uspols</a> package includes a simple function for scraping a Wikipedia-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Donald_Trump_presidency">timeline of the Trump presidency</a> – <code>uspols_wiki_timeline()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(devtools)
devtools::install_github(&quot;jaytimm/uspols&quot;)
library(uspols) </code></pre>
<p>The function returns an up-to-date table of daily administration happenings from 20 Jan 2017 onward. Here we walk through a simple work-flow for adding timeline data to time series data. While not an official accounting, <strong>a super quick/easy way to get one’s bearings (in a maelstrom) and contextualize data points</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>longs &lt;- uspols::uspols_wiki_timeline()</code></pre>
<p><strong>Table structure is detailed some below</strong>. The folks at Wikipedia have delineated events (chronologically?) via bullet points per each day of Trump’s presidency, which have been enumerated here in the <code>bullets</code> column as independent rows. I have mostly done this to make text easier to read/access/etc. I am not sure how meaningful event distinctions (for a given day) actually are.</p>

<pre class="r"><code>summary &lt;- longs %&gt;%

<p>For demonstration, we calculate total word counts of event descriptions per day from the time-line table. The plot below, then, summarizes these daily counts since inauguration. The plot itself is fairly meaningless, but the hover-action should be useful. For clarity purposes, only the first event for each day is included in the pop-up,.</p>
