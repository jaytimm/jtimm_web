<p>This post investigates linguistic diversity in the United States utilizing data made available by the US Census. We consider census language classifications, and introduce a simple methodology for quantifying linguistic diversity using entropy scores.</p>
<p>The post is largely exploratory, and a bit of an excuse to play with some different data visualization packages, including <code>ggridges</code> and <code>treemapify</code>, and to see about America some.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidycensus)

<h2>Language data and the census</h2>
<p>Language data in the US census live in census table <code>B16001</code>, which provides summary counts of speakers by language spoken at home. The <code>load_variables</code> function of the <code>tidycensus</code> package allows for nice and easy interaction with census tables and their constituent variables; using this function, then, we gather the relevant language variables included in table <code>B16001</code>,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>langs &lt;- load_variables(2015, &quot;acs5&quot;, cache = FALSE) %&gt;%
  filter(grepl(&quot;B16001&quot;,name) &amp; !grepl(&quot;Margin|Speak English|Total$&quot;,label)) %&gt;%
  mutate(name=gsub(&quot;E&quot;,&quot;&quot;,name),label=gsub(&quot;^.*!!&quot;,&quot;&quot;,label))%&gt;%
  select(-concept)</code></pre>
<p>The US census provides counts of speakers for the following language categories:</p>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Speak only English | Spanish or Spanish Creole | French (incl. Patois, Cajun) | French Creole | Italian | Portuguese or Portuguese Creole | German | Yiddish | Other West Germanic languages | Scandinavian languages | Greek | Russian | Polish | Serbo-Croatian | Other Slavic languages | Armenian | Persian | Gujarati | Hindi | Urdu | Other Indic languages | Other Indo-European languages | Chinese | Japanese | Korean | Mon-Khmer, Cambodian | Hmong | Thai | Laotian | Vietnamese | Other Asian languages | Tagalog | Other Pacific Island languages | Navajo | Other Native North American languages | Hungarian | Arabic | Hebrew | African languages | Other and unspecified languages&quot;</code></pre>
<p>These 40 languages/language categories are cleaned up some in the table below, where we add some details implicit in the censusâ€™ classification scheme. While the classifications would leave a linguistic typologist nonplussed, for our purposes here they are fine. <br/> <div id="htmlwidget-1" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>

<p><br/> Using <code>tidycensus</code>, we pull counts of speakers for the languages listed above for each county in the US, along with the <code>summary_var</code> (or denominator), which amounts to the population over 5.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>langData &lt;- tidycensus::get_acs(geography = &quot;county&quot;,variables = langs$name, summary_var=&quot;B16001_001&quot;, survey=&quot;acs5&quot;, year=2015) %&gt;%
  left_join(sumLangs,by=c(&quot;variable&quot;=&quot;name&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>As an example to explore the data some, we consider languages spoken at home for a county famous for its linguistic diversity: Queens County, New York. Of the 40 language classifications included in the census, Queens is home to speakers of 39 (per 2011-15 5-year estimates).</p>
<p>Using the <code>treemapify</code> package, the plot below summarizes languages spoken in Queens. Rectangle areas represent the proportion of total speakers, colors reflect language types/families, and sub-tiles reflect within-type languages. While only exploratory, the plot nicely captures how diverse Queens is in terms of languages spoken by its residents.</p>

<div id="linguistic-diversity-as-entropy" class="section level2">
<h2>Linguistic diversity as entropy</h2>
<p>To get a better sense of where the linguistic diversity attested in the plot above distributes geographically, we calculate <em>entropy scores</em> for each county within the US. Entropy, <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, for a given county, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, is calculated as <span class="math display">\[E_i = \sum_{r=1}^n Q_r ln\frac{1}{Q_r}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Q_r\)</span> is the proportion of speakers of language <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of languages spoken (also know as <em>Richness</em>).</p>
<p>Per this metric, maximum entropy would mean that each of the 4o census language types were spoken by equal numbers of people within a given county; minimum entropy would mean that all speakers within a given county spoke the same language .</p>
<p>This metric (and like-minded variants) is often used in socio-demographic research to assess racial/ethnic diversity, as well as in ecological research to evaluate species diversity and richness.</p>

<h2>Locating linguistic diversity</h2>
<p>Based on these derived entropy scores, the table below summarizes the fifty most linguistically diverse counties in the US. As can be noted, Queens tops the list. A close second is Santa Clara County, California, which is home to Silicon Valley. Alameda and San Mateo counties are part of the SF Bay Area. As such, it would seem that entropy scores align well with intuition.</p>

<p><br/> Perhaps unsurprisingly, linguistic diversity as approximated by entropy scores is highest in major metropolitan areas in the northeast, southern Florida, the southwest, Bay Area &amp; southern California, and the Pacific Northwest.<br />
â€”</p>
<p>Lastly, we consider the distribution of county entropy scores within each division. The <code>ggridges</code> package makes this task relatively straightforward. The figure below, then, illustrates density plots for county-level entropy scores by division.</p>
<p>While the plot is comprised of the same data as the choropleth map above, I think it provides a more succinct perspective on variation in linguistic diversity across divisions, as well as a nice â€˜profileâ€™ of linguistic diversity within divisions.</p>

<p>So, some different perspectives on linguistic diversity in the United States via US Census (ACS) data, and some different approaches to visualizing variation across distributions.
