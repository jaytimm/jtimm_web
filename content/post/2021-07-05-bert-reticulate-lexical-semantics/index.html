<div id="intro" class="section level2">
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>This post provides some quick details on using <code>reticulate</code> to interface Python from RStudio; and, more specifically, using the <code>spacy</code> library and BERT for fine-grained lexical semantic investigation. Here we present a (very cursory) usage-based/BERT-based perspective on the semantic distinction between <code>further</code> and <code>farther</code>, using example contexts extracted from the <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a> (COCA).</p>
</div>
<div id="python-reticulate-set-up" class="section level2">
<h2>Python &amp; reticulate set-up</h2>
<p>The Python code below sets up a conda environment and installs relevant libraries, as well as the BERT transformer, <em>en_core_web_trf</em>. The following should be run in the terminal.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>conda create -n poly1
source activate poly1
conda install -c conda-forge spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
conda install numpy scipy pandas</code></pre>
<p>The R code below directs R to our Python environment and Python installation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reticulate::use_python(&quot;/usr/local/bin/python&quot;)  
reticulate::use_condaenv(&quot;poly1&quot;, &quot;/home/jtimm/anaconda3/bin/conda&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="coca" class="section level2">
<h2>COCA</h2>
<p>The Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) is an absolutely lovely resource, and is one of <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/">many corpora</a> made available by the folks at BYU. Here, we utilize COCA to build a simple data set of <code>further</code>-<code>farther</code> example usages. I have copied/pasted from COCA’s online search interface – the data set includes ~500 contexts of usage per form.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
gw &lt;- read.csv(paste0(ld, &#39;further-farther.csv&#39;), sep = &#39;\t&#39;)
gw$sent &lt;- tolower(gsub(&quot;([[:punct:]])&quot;, &quot; \\1 &quot;, gw$text))
gw$sent &lt;- gsub(&quot;^ *|(?&lt;= ) | *$&quot;, &quot;&quot;, gw$sent, perl = TRUE)

gw$count &lt;- stringr::str_count(gw$sent, &#39;further|farther&#39;)
gw0 &lt;- subset(gw, count == 1)</code></pre>
<p>For a nice discussion on the semantics of <code>further</code>-<code>farther</code>, see this <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/is-it-further-or-farther-usage-how-to-use">Merriam-Webster post</a>. The standard semantic distinction drawn between the two forms is physical versus metaphorical distance.</p>
<p>Some highlighting &amp; sample data below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fu &lt;- &#39;\\1 &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:lightgreen&quot;&gt;\\2&lt;/span&gt; \\3&#39;

<div id="bert-contextual-embeddings" class="section level2">
<h2>BERT &amp; contextual embeddings</h2>
<p>Using BERT and <code>spacy</code> for computing contextual word embeddings is actually fairly straightforward. A very nice resource for some theoretical overview as well as code demo with BERT/spacy is available <a href="https://applied-language-technology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/part_iii/04_embeddings_continued.html#visualising-word-embeddings">here</a>.</p>
<p>Getting started, we pass our data set from R to Python via the <code>r_to_py</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- reticulate::r_to_py(gw0)</code></pre>
<p>Then, from a Python console, we load the BERT transformer using <code>spacy</code>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import spacy
nlp = spacy.load(&#39;en_core_web_trf&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><strong>The stretch of Python code below does all the work here</strong>. The transformer computes a 768 dimension vector per token/sub-token comprising each context – then we extract the tensor for either <code>further</code>/<code>farther</code> using the token index. The resulting data structure is matrix-like, with each instantiation of <code>further</code>-<code>farther</code> represented in 768 dimensions.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def encode(sent, index):
  doc = nlp(sent.lower())
  tensor_ix = doc._.trf_data.align[index].data.flatten()
  out_dim = doc._.trf_data.tensors[0].shape[-1]
  tensor = doc._.trf_data.tensors[0].reshape(-1, out_dim)[tensor_ix]
  ## tensor.__len__()
  return tensor.mean(axis=0)

r.df[&quot;emb&quot;] = r.df[[&quot;sent&quot;, &quot;idx&quot;]].apply(lambda x: encode(x[0], x[1]), axis = 1)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="tsne" class="section level2">
<h2>tSNE</h2>
<p>To plot these contexts in two dimensions, we use tSNE to reduce the 768-dimension word embeddings to two. Via Python and <code>numpy</code>, we create a matrix-proper from the <code>further</code>-<code>farther</code> token embeddings extracted above.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import numpy as np
X, y  = r.df[&quot;emb&quot;].values, r.df[&quot;id&quot;].values
X = np.vstack(X)</code></pre>
<p>For good measure, we switch back to R to run tSNE. The matrix X, built in Python, is accessed in the R console below via <code>reticulate::py$X</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(999) ## 
tsne &lt;- Rtsne::Rtsne(X = as.matrix(reticulate::py$X), 
                     check_duplicates = FALSE)

tsne_clean &lt;- data.frame(reticulate::py_to_r(df), tsne$Y) %&gt;%
  
  mutate(t1 = gsub(&#39;(further|farther)&#39;, &#39;\\&lt;\\1\\&gt;&#39;, text, ignore.case = T),
         t2 = stringr::str_wrap(string = t1,
                                  width = 20,
                                  indent = 1,
                                  exdent = 1),
         id = row_number()) %&gt;%
  select(id, form, X1, X2, t1, t2) </code></pre>
<p>The scatter plot below summarizes contextual embeddings for individual tokens of <code>further</code>-<code>farther</code>. So, a nice space for <code>further</code> used adjectivally on the right side of the plot. Other spaces less obviously structured, and some confused spaces as well where speakers seem to have quite a bit of leeway.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(tsne_clean, 
                          aes(x = X1, 
                              y = X2,
                              color = form,
                              text = t2,
                              key = id )) +
